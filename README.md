Recipe App for the Family

# Instructions to Run
TBD - Client and Server are being run from seperate places at this moment. 

# Purpose
This project is only for using in the family to keep up with recipes we have gathered and enjoyed over the years. It is meant to allow for our kids 
and relatives to be able to access and locate any of the things we have cooked over time. 

# NOTE: 
This is an ongoing personal project and is likely to take many turns along the way.
